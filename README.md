# kmeans_mpi
Parallelizing a (given) implementation of the K-Means algorithm with MPI

## TODO
* [ ] sequential .c file (outputs `output\nexec time`)
* [ ] parallel .c file (output `output\nexec time`)
* [ ] sequential .c file for sequential % analysis (outputs % of time spent in sequential areas of the code)
* [ ] parallel .c file for sequential % analysis (outputs % of time spent in sequential areas of the code)
* [ ] script for initialization (create inputs directory, etc)
* [ ] script for testing using the four .c files above and input files
